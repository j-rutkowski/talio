# Code of conduct feedback

### Submission

Mark: Pass

### General

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Everything is filled in and most section have enough detail without unnecessary information. Some section are however not detailed enough and could stand more elaboration.


### Assignment Description

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: All information is correct and detailed enough, without unnecessary information.

### Products

Mark: Good

Feedback: Well structured and clear, but missing details in regards to the specific deliverables and the standards you will be using to assess the quality of your work.

### Planning

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The goals and agreements are clear, realistic, and well-structured, and it's very good that you also included how GitLab will play into this, however, you could elaborate more on the planning process (e.g. how timely should someone announce when they're unavailable, how do you decide how you will plan your internal deadlines, etc.).

### Communication

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You have a clear plan for which channels to use for which information, however, you could elaborate more on exactly what kind of matters will be discussed on which platform (e.g. when you upload an important document, do you also notify the TA about it, and if so, on which platform, etc.). Also for Google Drive, I suggest specifying that that's an platform that you use so share documents internally, as all documents still will we uploaded either on GitLab or on Brightspace. 


### Commitment

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very good and clear agreements on the assessing the quality of the group work, but the agreements on assessing the quality of the chairman's and minute taker's commitment could use more elaboration (e.g. for the minute taker you specify that it's their role to write down what's being discussed in the meetings, but how do you assess the quality of these notes?).


### Division of Tasks and Roles
 
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Great planning! It's really good to make it clear from the beginning when each person will reprise their roles so that they can prepare timely, but you didn't mention how this will be reflected into GitLab (e.g. will the chairman have issues related to making the agenda?).

### Meetings
 
Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No clear arrangements were made regarding meetings outside of the TA meeting. This question is reffering to internal meetings that your team has outside of the official TA ones. 

### Decision Making
  
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very detailed and clear arrangements have been made in regards to the decision making, great job! But also consider the scenario when an agreement is not reached. How does the TA play into this?

### Dealing with Conflicts
 
Mark: Excellent

Feedback: No extra feedback to give here, the agreement you reached is really good and clear, and I like that you mentioned that above all, we should still respect each other and treat each other fairly, even in conflicts. :)

### Guidance
 
Mark: Excellent

### Consequences
  
Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agreement you reached is very reasonable and fair, great job on it!

### Success Factors
 
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Your success factors are fair and strong, but your answer could play a bit more on specific qualities that you have and which together make you a dream team.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria
 
Mark: Good

Feedback: The criterias you chose are important and fair, but you just enumerated them, with no explanation or description of why these are important to the team.
