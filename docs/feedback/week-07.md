# Meeting Feedback

1) Meeting organization: Pass - The chairman and minute taker were assigned from the previous meeting.

2) Agenda: Excellent - Agenda followed the template and covered all the relevant topics.

3) Chair performance: Excellent - Chair took the lead well and covered all the topics of the agenda, and created a friendly and professional atmosphere where everybody was encouraged to participate and jump into the discussion.

4) Time management: Excellent - All proposed topics were covered, with sufficient time for each of them.

5) Minute taker performance: Excellent - The original minute taker was late, so somebody else took their place. Took notes about everything, and was also active in asking people about stuff that was not mentioned but he needed to note down.   
 
6) Attitude & Relation: Very good - Everybody participated in the discussion topics, in equal amounts, and everybody was listened to. The chair did a great job at involving people in the conversation. 

7) Potentially Shippable Product: Very good - The shippable product containted a lot more features and it was more polished than last week. The Minimal Application features are done, and you have already moved on to the advanced ones. It would've been an "Excellent", if not for the fact that some  of the features still needed some working on and had some bugs (e.g. the drag and drop).
