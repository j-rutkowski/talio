### Backlog feedback

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file format is right.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The stakeholder cardList is quite bare, you could try to think of more entities that hold a stake in the application.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There is no cardList of epics. I suggest organizing a cardList of epics similar to the one shown in the lectures, and prioritizing it similarly. Don't forget to introduce an epic clearly. Optionally, you could also use mockups to complement the description.


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories don't follow the required format (e.g. no reasoning is given for why I user would want a certain feature). In terms of user focus however, good job, as all user stories have a clear focus on the user perspective. There are no obvious "gaps" feature-wise, but for completeness the user stories need to cover an epic that they are related to.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Most user stories are quite concise and clear, and they are formulated well, in such a way that you can measure when a user story has been completed. There are some user stories however that are quite bare and lack elaboration, and for such user stories it is hard to measure/observe a way that allows to decide when that story is done/finished.
