# Feedback

1) Meeting organization: Pass - The chairman and minute taker were assigned from the previous meeting.

2) Agenda: Excellent - Agenda followed the template and covered all the relevant topics. 

3) Chair performance: Excellent - Chair took the lead well and covered all the topics of the agenda, and created a friendly and professional atmosphere where everybody was encouraged to participate and jump into the discussion.

4) Time management: Excellent - All proposed topics were covered, with sufficient time for each of them.

5) Minute taker performance: Excellent - Took notes about everything, and was also active in asking people about stuff that was not mentioned but he needed to note down. He was also active in clarifying aspects that he needed to write down. Also when someone joined the meeting later, he took the lead into bringing that person up to speed about what was discussed. 

6) Attitude & Relation: Very Good - Everybody participated in the discussion topics, in somewhat equal amounts, and everybody was listened to. The chair did a great job at involving people in the conversation, however, some team members were not eager to join the discussion.  

7) Potentially Shippable Product: Excellent - The showcased product already had some functionality implemented, both server side and client side, and it already took into consideration unwanted behaviour (e.g. when adding a card, if you didn't type in a title, you could not add it, and you received a warning on the screen that you need to include a title to be able to add it).
