# Feedback

1) Meeting organization: Pass - The chairman and minute taker were assigned from the previous meeting.

2) Agenda: Insufficient - The agenda was not in the repo at the time of the meeting. 

3) Chair performance: Very good - Chair took the lead well and covered all the topics of the agenda, and created a friendly and professional atmosphere where everybody was encouraged to participate and jump into the discussion. It would've been an "Excellent", if not for the fact that he forgot to upload the agenda beforehand.

4) Time management: Excellent - All proposed topics were covered, with sufficient time for each of them.

5) Minute taker performance: Excellent - Took notes about everything, and was also active in asking people about stuff that was not mentioned but he needed to note down.   

6) Attitude & Relation: Excellent - Everybody participated in the discussion topics, in equal amounts, and everybody was listened to. The chair did a great job at involving people in the conversation. 

7) Potentially Shippable Product: Good - The product you showcased me in main is functional, but the progress from our meeting 2 weeks ago is not that significant. Also some of the features still have bugs (e.g. when adding a lot of cards, the "Add card" button doesn't move and it just goes on top of cards). However, there was a lot more functionality in the "websockets" branch that you showed me. It was extensive and functioning well, great job  on that! There seemed to be even more functionality than it was in the main branch. In the future sprints, strive to not have big pieces of functionality not yet merged, and have everything that is finished in main before our meetings.
